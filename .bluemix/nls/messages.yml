name: "Microservices toolchain"
description: "With this cloud-native toolchain, you use a sample to create an online store that consists of three microservices: a Catalog API, an Orders API, and a UI that calls both of the APIs. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, blue-green deployment, functional testing, issue tracking, online editing, and alert notification.\n\nThe Catalog and Orders API are backed by a Cloudant store. As part of deploying this application a no cost Cloudant service instance will be created. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
